# Clojure <> PagerDuty

Very much a simple start as I was trying to navigate the incidents and
schedules for my organization and didn't find any prior art here.

Maybe it's useful to you.  PRs welcome.  Generating code from the
[openapi spec](https://github.com/PagerDuty/api-schema) did not work
for me, so that would be a helpful addition.

## Usage

1. Create an API token in the "User Settings" tab in your profile.
2. Plug that into the `tok` argument to the primary functions.
